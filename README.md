Class Project

This is a project for my graduate-level statistical methods course; which introduced statistical methods for supervised and unsupervised learning. Including topics of regression and classification, such as linear regression, multiple regression, logistic regression and K-nearest neighbors. Other topics studied and applied; but not presented on this project are: polynomial regression, splines regression, tree regression, random forests, ridge regression and the Lasso, linear and quadratic discriminant analysis, support vector machines, artificial neural networks regularization techniques, and boosting techniques.
